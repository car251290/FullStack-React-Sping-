This article can serve as a motivation to learn more about the topic. And I have some good news: I am planning to write about REST Best Practices and common mistakes in the near future.

## Post Https

The PUT Method
PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users will make the same request but will not return the list of users.

HEAD requests are useful for checking what a GET request will return before actually making a GET request - like before downloading a large file or response body.
